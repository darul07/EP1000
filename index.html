            <p>Safety is number one priority when working in our laboratories and workshop. Document the main points, information that you need to take note of when working in SP Fablab, what are some of the key do’s and don’t’s that you need to take note of, what to do in case of emergencies.<br>

           <p>Dresscode is an important part of safety as it minimises the chance of accidents happening or it plays a part of protecting oneself if an accident do happen.<br>

          <p>To summarize, IMPORTANT points are mentioned below:

          <p>-You are RESPONSIBLE for the workplace safety on all stakeholders along lines of control at the workplace.        
          <p>-Report ALL work related injuries(no matter how minor), promptly to technical support staff or supervising staff.
          <p>-Contact the school’s general office, 67721206 or call 67721234 when treatment to injury is required.
          <p>-Proper attire is a MUST(example, long pants, no slippers, tied hair and more)

            <h1>Website Development</h1>
            
            <p>To start off with the web development, i have chosen Subliume Text 3 as my text editor among others such as Visual Studios and Notepad++ as it is relatively easy for beginners and also free to use.As version control, we had to use Github
              <p>This was my first and original About Me Page. At that time i was still unsure of how to add an image.<br>
              <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/Screenshot (57).png"  style="width:50%" >

            <p>I have learnt that the naming of the images are really important for the code to recognise and a small difference in name will cause it to not show the image

            <p>CSS
            <p>-CSS is needed to create the design of a webpage and defines how a webpage will look like. It organises the information into different sections and gives it colors 

            <p>Github   
            <p>-Github allows for version control which means you can simply load back the previous version of saved codes without having to recode it. This allows for easy recovery if mistakes have been made or the code been accidently deleted.
            <p>Github also allows you to view what changes have been made to the previous version.
            <p>When you have finalised on all the changes, you can commit to main to upload the changes into the local repository.<br>
             <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/Screenshot (58).png"  style="width:50%" >



              <div class="w3-container w3-white">
            <h1>Computer Aided Design</h1>
            <p>CAD allows us to design whatever we want and later through different methods such as 3D printing or laser cutting fabricate it into a physical object.
            <p>As for the software, we chose Fusion 360. Fusion 360 is rly similar to other CAD software that i have used in Year 1 and 2 such as Inventor thus it was relatively simple transitioning to it. It is really user friendly and simple to take your design from Fusion to 3D print and laser cut. Here are some exercises that i did. I used a template of the Knight chess piece and traced its outline. As for its circular base, i used the revolve feature.<br>

              <div class="w3-container w3-white">
            <h1>Laser Cutting</h1>
            
            <p>Laser cutting uses a guided laser that vaporises material as it goes along. It cuts with extreme precision and speed. For us, wood and acrylic sheets are used to fabricate our projects. The image below shows hopw the CAD drawing is orientated to be sent for laser cutting.<br>
              <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/Screenshot (62).png"  style="width:50%" >
            <p>The 3D shape of your design has to be laid out flat in order the be laser cut as the laser cutter only moves in a 2 dimensional plane. The thickness of the walls depends on the thickness of your material, which in my case was a 5mm thick wooden sheet

            Imaages can also be engraved using the same laser cutter. The images below shows the fully assembled and engraved music box.<br>
            <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/box1.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
            <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/box2.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
            <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/box3.jfif"  style="width:50%" >



              <div class="w3-container w3-white">
            <h1>3D Printing and Modelling</h1>
            
            <p>3D Printing uses both Fusion 360 and Ultimaker Cura. The 3D printed object is printed layer by layer by the 3D printer which in our Fablab is the Ultimaker 2+. A 3D model is converted into STL file which is the sliced and converted into g-codes. The g-codes are then uploaded into the 3D printer. It is a relatively slow process but fast compared to tradional fabrication methods and its great for prototyping as it is cheap and you can tweak the design and simply print again. There are a few considerations when it comes to 3D printing.The layer height, wall thickness and infill. These factors contribute to the print time, strength, weight and finish of the printed part. The image below shows the 3D printed Knight chess piece.<br> 
            <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/knight.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
            <p>There was some post processing involved as there were automatically generated supports for the overhang. I used a pair of pliers to break and remove the supports. As was relatively quick as it is a small piece. I then used files to smoothen some uneven edges left behind by the supports.

             <div class="w3-container w3-white"> 
            <p><b><h1>Electronics</h1></b></p>
            
            <p>I used Arduino.ide as the programming software to code for the arduino uno as it is a free and easy to navigate software.<br>
              <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/Screenshot (63).png"  style="width:75%" >
            <p>We were also introduced some electronic devices such as switches, motion detector sensor, rotary encoder, LEDs, Neopixels, etc.

            <p>We were tasked to try some of these circuits.
