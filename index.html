          <p>-Report ALL work related injuries(no matter how minor), promptly to technical support staff or supervising staff.
          <p>-Contact the school’s general office, 67721206 or call 67721234 when treatment to injury is required.
          <p>-Proper attire is a MUST(example, long pants, no slippers, tied hair and more)

            <h1>Website Development</h1>
            
            <p>To start off with the web development, i have chosen Subliume Text 3 as my text editor among others such as Visual Studios and Notepad++ as it is relatively easy for beginners and also free to use.As version control, we had to use Github
              <p>This was my first and original About Me Page. At that time i was still unsure of how to add an image.<br>
              <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/Screenshot (57).png"  style="width:50%" >

            <p>I have learnt that the naming of the images are really important for the code to recognise and a small difference in name will cause it to not show the image

            <p>CSS
            <p>-CSS is needed to create the design of a webpage and defines how a webpage will look like. It organises the information into different sections and gives it colors 

            <p>Github   
            <p>-Github allows for version control which means you can simply load back the previous version of saved codes without having to recode it. This allows for easy recovery if mistakes have been made or the code been accidently deleted.
            <p>Github also allows you to view what changes have been made to the previous version.
            <p>When you have finalised on all the changes, you can commit to main to upload the changes into the local repository.<br>

            <h1>Computer Aided Design</h1>
            <p>CAD allows us to design whatever we want and later through different methods such as 3D printing or laser cutting fabricate it into a physical object.
            <p>As for the software, we chose Fusion 360. Fusion 360 is rly similar to other CAD software that i have used in Year 1 and 2 such as Inventor thus it was relatively simple transitioning to it. It is really user friendly and simple to take your design from Fusion to 3D print and laser cut. Here are some exercises that i did. I used a template of the Knight chess piece and traced its outline. As for its circular base, i used the revolve feature.<br>

            <h1>Laser Cutting</h1>
            
            <p>Laser cutting uses a guided laser that vaporises material as it goes along. It cuts with extreme precision and speed. For us, wood and acrylic sheets are used to fabricate our projects. The image below shows hopw the CAD drawing is orientated to be sent for laser cutting.<br>
              <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/Screenshot (62).png"  style="width:50%" >
            <p>The 3D shape of your design has to be laid out flat in order the be laser cut as the laser cutter only moves in a 2 dimensional plane. The thickness of the walls depends on the thickness of your material, which in my case was a 5mm thick wooden sheet

            Imaages can also be engraved using the same laser cutter. The images below shows the fully assembled and engraved music box.<br>

              <div class="w3-container w3-white">
            <h1>3D Printing and Modelling</h1>
            
            <p>3D Printing uses both Fusion 360 and Ultimaker Cura. The 3D printed object is printed layer by layer by the 3D printer which in our Fablab is the Ultimaker 2+. A 3D model is converted into STL file which is the sliced and converted into g-codes. The g-codes are then uploaded into the 3D printer. It is a relatively slow process but fast compared to tradional fabrication methods and its great for prototyping as it is cheap and you can tweak the design and simply print again. There are a few considerations when it comes to 3D printing.The layer height, wall thickness and infill. These factors contribute to the print time, strength, weight and finish of the printed part. The image below shows the 3D printed Knight chess piece.<br> 
            <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/knight.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
            <p>There was some post processing involved as there were automatically generated supports for the overhang. I used a pair of pliers to break and remove the supports. As was relatively quick as it is a small piece. I then used files to smoothen some uneven edges left behind by the supports.

    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Final Project</span></h2>
    
    <p>For my Final Project, I decided to make a giant volume controller. It is connected to the computer through USB. It has the ability to adjust the media volume of the computer simply by rotating the knob clockwise(to increase volume) or anti-clockwise(to decrease volume). It also has RGB lighting which can be seen through the laser-cut holes.<br>

    <h1>Sketch and Model</h1>
    <p>I already had a rough idea of how i wanted it to look like since the start.
      <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/sketch.jfif"  style="width:75%" >
        <p class="w3-center">I wanted it to be sloped towards the user for a more comfortable experience as the angle makes it easier to control the knob<br>
          <p class="w3-center">This is the 3D model of the product.
            <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/Screenshot (64).png"  style="width:75%" >
              <p class="w3-center">The RGB lighting shines through the laser-cut holes in the form of a volume symbol.

    <h1>Electronics</h1>
    <p>In order for the volume contoller to work, a rotary encoder have to be used.
      <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/rotary.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
        <p class="w3-center">It converts angular position to analog or digital inputs.<br><br>

    <p class="w3-center"> Next is the brains of the project, the Arduino Nano.
      <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/nano.jpg"  style="width:50%" ><br><br>

    <p class="w3-center"> Neopixels are used to give it its RGB lighting.
      <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/neo.jfif"  style="width:50%" ><br><br>

    <h1>Laser Cutting</h1>
    <p>The main body of the volume controller will be laser-cut 5mm thick wood.
      <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/cutwood.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
        <p class="w3-center">The pieces came out exactly as i wanted it and it all fits perfectly<br><br>  

    <h1>3D Printing</h1>  
    <p>The rotating knob of the volume controller will be 3D printed.
      <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/3dprint2.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
        <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/3dprint.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
          <p class="w3-center">The hole in the middle is for the rotary encoder to be inserted into. The rotary encoder was measured to be 6mm in diameter thus i designed the hole to be 6.5mm. The printed knob has a snug fit which was ideal as it meant that it can be easily installed yet tight enough so that the rotary encoder can rotate when the knob is rotated.<br><br>  

    <h1>Wiring and Coding</h1>
    <p>For wiring, it was as simple as connecting the rotary encoder and neopixels to the correct terminals on the breadboard and on the arduino.
      <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/wire1.jpeg"  style="width:50%" >
        <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/wire2.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
        <p>As for the codes, I took it from Adafruit. For some reason it could not work with the Arduino Nano so i settled with Arduino Uno instead. Luckily, the shell of my volume controller had enough space to fit both the Arduino Uno and the mini breadboard<br><br>
          
    <h1>Final Product</h1>
    <p>This is how it looks like after integrating all the components
    <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/frontview.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
     <p class="w3-center"><img src="images/backview.jfif"  style="width:50%" >
      <p>This elective has been fun and educational as we get to learn skills that are hard to find in other modules. Being able to integrate everything we learn during the semester into a final project was tough but meaningful as we overcome different setbacks and challenges.<br>  <br>
